    aiSampleArgument: "As the new CEO of a struggling retail chain, I would implement a three-phase digital transformation strategy. Phase one focuses on e-commerce infrastructure - our online sales represent only 15% of revenue compared to industry average of 35%. We'll invest $2 million over six months to upgrade our platform and logistics. Phase two involves employee retraining - 70% of our workforce needs digital skills development. This isn't just about technology; it's about preserving jobs while adapting to market realities. Phase three targets customer experience through omnichannel integration, potentially increasing customer lifetime value by 25% based on similar transformations in our sector."
